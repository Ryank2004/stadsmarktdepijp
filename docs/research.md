# Research Stadsmarkt De Pijp

### What is the current visual identity?

They have a very small website at the moment. They aren't even using the real logo. The only visual identity I see is the red color. This represents the main color pf the store Stadsmarkt and Landmarkt.

### What kind of colors, images and typography fits for a new website?

Michael told me he likes the style the Landmarkt website has. Landmarkt uses "sale" font and also uses their red color.
I was thinking to give each stand its own color. Fish = blue, meat = red, cheese = yellow, vegetables = green etc.

I will use this font for headings and subheadings as well.
In the supermarkets you come across a lot of hand drawn illustrations like this:

This would give a lot of visual identity to the website. I need to check who makes these drawings and see if I can get access to them.

I also like SVG's like these:

Instead of only using the red color on the site, I can give every stand (like the butcher, vegetables, cheese, fish) their own color  and show them with these SVG's

### Are there other(bio) supermarkets with inspiring websites?

I've checked the websites of:

- Marqt
- Ekoplaza
- Odin

These are all bio supermarktes. Marqt is the most similar to Stadsmarkt De Pijp
They also had the most interesting site, the rest was a little outdated.

I really liked the hover menu. It's super simple but feels smooth.
It also saves the user some clicks.
The rest of the site wasn't very impressive.

### Which websites are similar to this project in terms of structure or target audience?

The website of [Landmarkt](https://landmarkt.nl) is very similar in terms of audience.
[Marqt](https://marqt.nl) also has a website for a similar audience.

Landmarkt's structure is more the same, because they are also focusing on the "versmarkt". Here they show each stand with their specialty. Marqt is focussing more on their food.

### What do they do well in terms of storytelling, navigation, and imagery?

[Landmarkt](https://landmarkt.nl) is using simple navigation with some decent images.
I do like their imagery. It looks hand drawn and fits their image. They could've used more throughout the site tho.

[Marqt](https://marqt.nl) has a simple "about" and a "our kitchen" page were they tell a story.
It's short but exactly tells what they stand for. They use high quality images on their site but because of the layout and font choices the site looks a bit cheap.

### How do they create a "market feel" digitally?

Only [Landmarkt](https://landmarkt.nl) tries to create this by just walking the user through the different stands of the market. They show it of with images and plain text.

### What are the minimum number of pages required?

There needs to be 4 pages in total.

1. Home
- A impression of the market/store with video/images
- Product of the month highlight
- Some team members

2. Suppliers
- A showcase of all the suppliers of Stadsmarkt and what their story is

3.  About/Our team
- The story of Stadsmarkt
- The team
- The owner

4. Contact
- Opening hours
- Location
- Info (phone number/E-mail)

### Is there a need for a map, for example? An event calendar?

Yes, a google maps map

### What are the call-to-actions (e.g., directions, contact, newsletter)?

The end goal is for the user to feel and see Stadsmarkt De Pijp, not necessarily to buy something. So the only real CTA could be a directions button next to the map.
